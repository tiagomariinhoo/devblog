In this post I will talk about some important projects that I have participated and about me.

## Pre Diabetics Recommendation System

In this project I was developing a smart application that analyzed users data and according to a decision tree (which was a database given by medical people), were given a diagnostic aid, showing whether the user tended to have diabetes or not.

The technologias we used in this project were: Java ,XML, Firebase and SQLite, using Android Studio.

This project brought me experience in Java and Android Studio, so I could use as a software developer on Edge today, the difference is that today, besides Java, I have also used a lot of Kotlin.

Later I will update my github page with some repository showing some application screens

## Projects at EDGE

## Personal projects

Some projects that I consider important were developed by me and my friends during my journey as a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Alagoas.

##### Pac Man using genetic algorithm

We developed a pacman where every monster in the game had a genetic algorithm running on it, which increased the probability that ghosts would trap pacman.

My repository with the Pacman project (in C++): https://github.com/tiagomariinhoo/Pacman-IA2

##### Competitive Programming

During my undergraduate degree I participated in the Computer Olympics and after that I participated four times in the Maratona de Programação, qualifying twice for the Brazilian finals. Competing against the best universities in the countrye, like ITA, USP, UFPE, among others.
